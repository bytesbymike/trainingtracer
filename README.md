Training Tracer
===============

Analyze workout data from fitness devices such as a Garmin
watch.

## Status ##
* Prototype / Experimental.  This is my first attempt at
  building an application with Clojure.  The code is likely
  to change dramatically!

## Scope ##
* Only handle TCX input.  Other formats can come later.
* Only support latest stable Chrome browser.
* Interaction may be limited to REPL.  UI can come later.

## Immediate Goals ##
* DONE Read TCX data into Clojure data structure
* TODO Plot HR, pace against distance or time
* TODO Plot laps
* TODO Edit laps:
    * Add, delete, merge, split, shrink and expand splits
* TODO Smooth HR and pace

## Next steps ##
